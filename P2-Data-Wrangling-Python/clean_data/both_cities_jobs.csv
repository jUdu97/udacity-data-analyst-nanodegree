Lead Data Engineer,ThoughtWorks,"ThoughtWorks is a global software consultancy, made up of around 4,500 passionate technologists across 15 countries. We specialize in strategy, portfolio management and product design, combined with digital engineering excellence.

As a Lead Data Engineer, here's what we'll be looking for you to bring:


Hands-on Engineering Leadership
Proven track record of Innovation and expertise in Data Engineering
Tenure in coding, architecting and delivering complex projects
Deep understanding and application of modern data processing technology stacks. For example Spark, Hadoop ecosystem technologies, and others
Deep understanding of streaming data architectures and technologies for real-time and low-latency data processing
Deep understanding of NoSQL technologies including column family, graph, document, and key-value data storage technologies

Understanding of the theory and application of Continuous Integration/Delivery
Passion for software craftsmanship
A rich breadth of industry experience and background working across different organizations, ranging in size, from start-ups to large corporations..
Strong stakeholder management and interaction experience at different levels

There's no typical day or engagement for our Senior Data Engineers. Here’s what you’ll do:


Be the SME. Develop modern data architectural approaches to meet key business objectives and provide end to end data solutions
You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organizational review, helping them to understand the potential that data brings to solve their most pressing problems.
On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a program inception to build a new product.
It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you're equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution.
Whatever your role, the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue delivering without undue pressure.
You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.
You recognize that building your network with a client is absolutely key to enable you to perform in your role. You'll be drawing on all of your passion for technology, hands-on experience and knowledge of latest Big Data and Engineering best practices to help you gain the respect and credibility of those around you.

A few important things to know:

Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people’s personal situations into account, but we know it’s not for everyone.
Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary.

Not quite ready to apply? Or maybe this isn’t the right role for you?

"WATER UTILITY FINANCIAL ANALYST & RESEARCH FELLOW, Institute for Sustainable Energy, Questrom School of Business",Boston University,"Topic: Water utility modeling that analyzes revenue stability and incorporates capital investments, focused on identifying utility business models that encourage sustainable water use while also being fiscally sustainable for the utility

Start Date: Immediately

Duration: Full-time, one-year position, with extension planned

Background

Water scarcity coupled with increasing population growth, increasing water demand, and declining infrastructure systems pose a threat to both the people of Texas and the vital freshwater inflow needed to feed sensitive bays and estuaries along the Gulf Coast. In order to increase water use efficiency in urban areas and enhance conservation of limited freshwater resources, many stakeholders are now considering fundamental changes in water management, including transitioning to integrated urban water management (IUWM) approaches such as ‘One Water.’

Boston University’s Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) is engaged in a multi-year project funded by the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation with the goal of assessing how siloed municipal water agencies in the state of Texas can transition to an IUWM model in order to increase water use efficiency in urban environments, revitalize aging infrastructure, and preserve freshwater inflow to the major bays and estuaries along the Texas Gulf Coast. ISE’s work is focused on integrated water utility financial modeling, and the model results will be used to establish recommendations of viable pathways to move to IUWM in Texas.

About the Institute for Sustainable Energy

The Boston University Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) is a university-wide center dedicated to facilitating the transition to a sustainable, climate-safe global energy system. Through interdisciplinary research, policy analysis, and collaborative engagement, our mission is to ensure that the energy systems of the world provide abundant, sustainable, and universally accessible energy services to both emerging and advanced economies. This enormous challenge will require new technologies and energy processes, new forms of financing and financial institutions, new policy approaches, and new forms of public governance, and new companies, industries, and markets. Our work spans all of the disciplines, departments, and colleges at BU and involves many partnerships with other researchers, policymakers, and industry. Core work areas comprise defining pathways to becoming the utility of the future in both the electric and water sectors, with a common theme of moving towards a business model based on electricity/water efficiency; emissions reduction in transportation; and city climate modeling.

Duties and Responsibilities

The Research Fellow will lead the development modeling work that builds on existing utility revenue models and incorporates analysis of maintaining revenue stability with capital investments factored in. The expanded model will incorporate key aspects of the One Water framework such as reuse, distributed water treatment and low impact development, and demand projection.

An expanded model will be a toolbox for utilities, providing analysis of different revenue and cost trajectories based on different urban water management strategies – including some that typically fall outside today’s utility framework. This can be a practical tool that supports effective implementation of integrated urban water management.

Specific responsibilities include:

Develop an analytical framework that enables assessment of various water utility business models based on the cost and revenue opportunities associated with holistic management of multiple types of water, including potable, graywater, blackwater, and stormwater.
Guide modeling work that enables quantitative analysis of an appropriate set of case studies representing different scenarios.
Produce, edit, and review technical reports, briefs, and presentations on modeling research.
Build strong relationships with key practitioners and stakeholders in the water industry in Texas and beyond.
Support communications with a National Advisory Committee associated with this project, and with the funder.
Pursue new project opportunities relating to water management and utility of the future.

Required Skills
The ideal applicant will have:

A PhD in a related field (e.g. energy/environmental sciences, energy engineering) is preferred. Candidates with a Masters degree in a related field or an MBA, plus substantial, relevant work experience may also be considered.
Expertise in water utility business models and best practices for infrastructure management.
Demonstrated experience designing, building, and using spreadsheet models for financial analysis.
A strong background in finance-related quantitative methods and data analysis.

"POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW, Quality of Medical Products at Boston University, USP Quality Institute",Boston University,"Boston University (BU) and the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) Quality Institute have partnered to establish a fellowship program. This Request for Applications (RFA) seeks early career scientists and researchers who wish to receive specialized training, conduct novel research, and contribute to the evidence base on the value of quality medicines.

The Fellowship in Quality of Medical Products will foster the research, scholarship, and careers of individuals who are poised to work with academia, government, and industry to advance knowledge about the impact or value of quality medicines. Fellows will have the unique opportunity to engage in real-world training experiences, including interactions with USP scientific staff and other stakeholders.

The USP Quality Institute defines medicine quality as a balanced, risk-based set of pre-specified characteristics, systems, and requirements that consistently ensure a medicine’s delivery of stated and implied clinical outcomes for patients. This definition encompasses all aspects of a medical product’s lifecycle, including design, manufacture, supply chain, storage and distribution, as well as falsification. Excluded from this definition is the quality or appropriateness of treatment guidelines and practices.

Product quality can be designed into, improved, and reinforced all along the medicine continuum, from initial drug research all the way through to the dispensing of the medicines. These interventions differ for different products, product classes, and geographies, and have varying costs, feasibility, and outcomes. Assessing which interventions are most actionable and potentially effective is of critical importance to promote judicious policies and investment aimed at promoting medicine quality. USP has strong, trust-based relationships with quality professionals and healthcare policy makers globally, as well as several well-established offices and training centers in regions throughout the world. These strengthen USP’s understanding of local priorities and specificities, as well as its ability to effectively disseminate robust evidence and recommendations.

Research
The potential consequences of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are significant and may include massive loss of life, widening socioeconomic disparities, and significant economic shortfalls. Approximately 700,000 people from around the world die each year due to drug-resistant infections.1 Estimates of the potential economic impact of AMR are uncertain, but could be as large as a global, annual GDP shortfall of nearly $3.4 trillion by 2030.2

Antimicrobial resistance is driven, in part, by pathogens’ exposure to medicines of poor quality or delivering sub-therapeutic doses of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Sub-therapeutic doses drive AMR when drug concentrations in the body are too low to quickly eradicate the infection, but are high enough to create a reproductive advantage for resistant mutants by killing susceptible pathogens, often referred to as the “mutant selection window.” Poor-quality medicines may be the result of (1) products produced under quality standards but degraded due to inappropriate storage or distribution, or (2) products produced under poor-quality standards, whether inadvertently or intentionally. Regardless of the root cause, issues with medicine quality abound, with the World Health Organization recently reporting that approximately 10% of medicines globally are substandard or falsified, and 40% of those are antimicrobials.3

Fellowship applicants are asked to propose a research project that aims to address an important evidentiary gap in demonstrating the value of medicine quality related to issues of antimicrobial resistance. Examples of such gaps may include:
Measuring the extent to which poor-quality medicines contribute to the rise of AMR
Understanding how resistance develops and spreads in relationship to poor quality medicines
Assessing how policies or practices to reduce the prevalence of poor-quality medicines in a healthcare system impacts the onset of AMR (“bending the AMR curve”)
The benefits of delaying or reducing the onset of AMR for individuals (e.g., health outcomes), societies (e.g., population social mobility), countries (e.g., GDP), or the global community
The impact of quality-improving interventions at specific points along the medicine continuum
The resource requirements or costs of assuring antimicrobial medicine quality
Identifying actionable solutions (i.e., resource, regulatory, or policy) to improving the fraction of quality antimicrobial medicines, and defining strategies and approaches to address hurdles that impede these efforts

Fellows will be expected to analyze data and report findings in peer-reviewed publications and to the broader scientific and policy making community. Data may be accessed from public sources or newly generated. In addition, USP resources referenced above can be made available to fellows in support of their research projects.

Mentorship
The fellowship will provide a research opportunity that includes a co-mentorship team comprising faculty from BU, experts at USP engaged in research related to quality in medicines, and members of the USP Quality Institute Advisory Group or Steering Committee. Working under the direction of co-mentors, the awarded fellow will refine a research plan, including considerations for Institutional Review Board and other implementation details (e.g., identifying and gathering data).

Co-mentors will commit to the full duration of the fellowship; they will collaborate in the supervision and guidance of the fellow’s research project as well as meaningful outcomes. That is, the fellow is expected to disseminate research methods and/or findings through high-impact, peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international research meetings. Research project(s) will be refined and conducted based on mutual interests and competencies of the fellow and co-mentors.

Fellowship Activities
The fellow will work with mentors to advance evidence for the value of medicines quality. Key activities and training outcomes include:
Initiate and independently conduct at least one research project on issues relevant to medicines quality, incorporating guidance from mentors as described above
Develop a comprehensive understanding of the value of quality medical products, its applications to public health, and key evidentiary gaps in the demonstration of that value
Collaborate with faculty and scientists from BU and USP on research initiatives
Attend scientific meetings and summarize the process and outcomes of such meetings
Present on selected medicine quality topics at meetings or in a written format
Experience learning opportunities with USP (e.g., direct interactions with staff, giving or attending presentations, attendance at select meetings)

Partner Organizations
Boston University seeks to understand the role between medicine quality and antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary data suggests that poor quality, beyond sub-therapeutic doses, contribute to resistance. With the help of this partnership, we plan on exploring this link rigorously and understanding how, and to what extent, degradation or presence of impurities lead to resistance. This data would be critical in our understanding and developing robust policy to protect vulnerable populations.

The Quality Institute is an objective, independent institute based at the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), a scientific non-profit organization whose mission is to improve global health through public standards and related programs that help ensure the quality, safety, and benefit of medicines and foods. The Quality Institute taps into global health, policy, scientific, and technical expertise to assess the benefits, costs, and feasibility of improving medicine quality. The Quality Institute will build a robust evidence base to facilitate evidence-based decisions that can help increase the availability of quality medicines everywhere, helping to build a foundation for a healthier world.

Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research,Evidera,"Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research (Waltham, MA)

The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:


Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.

The Role

You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:

Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)
Review, track and own annual sales target
Direct other ""non-billable"" activities (e.g. design conceptual approaches for proposals, supervise junior staff, identify and pursue business opportunities within Evidera and bring in new projects).
Serve as consultant to other principal investigators or staff on other systematic review projects.
Act as a guide and mentor to the staff across Evidera locations.
Travel (internationally), as is expected.

Skills and Experience


Demonstrated experience in systematic review (SLR) methods in health economics and/or health services research.
Deep understanding of research principles, relevant methodology and practical research implementation.
Specialist skills in network meta-analysis or epidemiology would be desirable, but are not essential.
Experience with HTA/regulatory submissions, including National Institute for Health and Care. Excellence, SMC, and other European HTA bodies and the European Medicines Agency
Excellent communication skills, including presentations.
Competent in written and spoken English.
Experience in using MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel.

Machine Learning Engineer with Java,WinterWyman,"Job # 161980
Be the first machine learning hire for an early stage startup disrupting their industry.
They have an impressive Director of R&amp;D whom you will report to. He has been in the AI space for several years and has rubbed elbows with some of the best AI minds in the world. The founder has had two successful exits in the past and has many deep relationships in the field. As a result, they are gaining new customers without doing any marketing at all.
Often times I see offerings that try to entirely change a marketplace. This is rarely realistic. The approach that I have seen be more effective is to disrupt the market by focusing on an area that you can truly change—their approach is to leverage what is already working in this industry and radically change a piece that needs a boost. Their machine learning technology is helping to change the industry.
This is a meritocracy; the CEO is adamant that the company needs to take the best idea regardless of whose idea it is. They are a professional environment with people who have interests and lives outside of work. They have a beautiful office in downtown Boston that is a short walk from the Green Line.
Requirements
Java and machine learning
2+ years of experience in industry
If you have a background in computational linguistics or NLP this could be a fit for you.
Because they have a couple of hires to make on this team with both Java and machine learning skills, they are comfortable hiring a Java software engineer with some machine learning skills or a machine learning expert with some Java. They can cater this role to either skill set, but both areas are requirements.

"Vice President, Development",Massachusetts General Hospital(MGH),"OVERVIEW OF ORGANIZATION AND POSITION

Massachusetts General Hospital was established to provide care to Boston's sick, regardless of socioeconomic status—an innovative idea in 1811. In the words of our founder, John Warren, MD, “When in distress, every man becomes our neighbor.” Today, Mass General is a 999-bed academic medical center which annually admits 48,000 inpatients, handles 1.5 million outpatient visits and 100,000 emergency room visits, and performs more than 42,000 surgical operations. With Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Mass General is a founding member of Partners HealthCare , a large integrated care delivery system that includes community hospitals, primary care and specialty physicians, specialty facilities, community health centers and other health-related entities. Mass General is consistently ranked among the top five hospitals in the United States by U.S. News &amp; World Report, currently recognized as #4 out of nearly 5,000 hospitals and the only hospital to be ranked in all 16 specialties considered in the rankings.

It also operates the largest hospital-based research program in the United States and is the top recipient of hospital research funding from the National Institutes of Health. Within an annual research budget of $900 million, 1,200 clinical trials are taking place at Mass General at any given time, paving the way for new and improved treatments for our patients locally and around the globe. Mass General is not only the original teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, but also its largest. In January 2015, Mass General was named the top medical and surgical residency institution in the nation by Doximity, the largest online network for physicians. Finally, the American Hospital Association awarded the 2015 Foster G. McGaw Prize for Excellence in Community Service to the hospital for leadership in addressing the opioid epidemic and social and economic determinants of health, reducing barriers to care for vulnerable populations and promoting health equity.

Mass General’s philanthropy program has grown to be among the most successful in academic medicine and health care. In FY 2017, its high-performing staff of 145 employees have raised $255M in gifts and pledges and has achieved a three-year rolling average of $270M. While the majority of contributions are derived from the “grateful patient, grateful family” constituency, there is a high level of giving by foundations, corporations and health related non-profit organizations. Fundraising programs are organized primarily around medical disciplines and clinical programs, but several frontline teams work on behalf of cross-institutional entities, e.g., nursing, community heath and global health. In 2013, Mass General completed The Campaign for the Third Century of MGH Medicine, which raised $1.72B, in excess of its $1.5B goal. The hospital has just begun the quiet phase of a new seven-year campaign which has a potential goal of $2.75B to $3.0B.

The Vice President will be a gifted professional with an exceptional track record in principal and major gift fundraising, in staff leadership and management, and in leadership within a comprehensive campaign. S/he will be a highly visible, hands-on partner with the Senior Vice President and development leadership, the Board of Trustees, key physicians and scientists, high-level volunteers, and administrative colleagues, offering a fresh voice and new perspectives to motivate and strengthen the team.

Reporting to the Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer, the Vice President will be chief of staff and chief operating officer. As chief of staff, the Vice President will brief and advise the Senior Vice President on current happenings, required actions and decision points related to Office operations and issues related to faculty and leadership involvement in major gift situations. As the chief operating officer, the Vice President will oversee the Office’s philanthropic functions. Her/his primary responsibilities in this domain will be to (1) ensure the effectiveness of fundraising and development support programs; (2) manage the Senior Management Team; and (3) oversee the planning and implementation of a campaign which will include expansion of the hospital’s fundraising base and engagement of a new class of donors of transformational gifts.

The Vice President will have four senior director-level direct reports – Senior Managing Directors (SMDs). Through these direct reports, and the next organizational level of Managing Directors, the Vice President will oversee a staff of 145, which is expected to increase over the full course of the campaign (concluding in 2024).With the Senior Vice President and the four Senior Managing Directors, the Vice President will comprise the Development Office’s strategic leadership team, serving as the nexus for the execution of MGH development strategy and achievement of organizational effectiveness.


PRINCIPAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

General: The Vice President will oversee and contribute broadly to all aspects of the Development Office’s front line fundraising and development support services, and will be a representative of the office with hospital, faculty and lay leaders. On behalf of the Senior Vice President, s/he will supervise the Senior Management Team, consisting of four Senior Managing Directors.

Specific: In consultation and/or collaboration with the Senior Managing Directors and with other managers as appropriate, the Vice President will:
Ø Oversee the development and execution of a comprehensive campaign to boost and amplify overall philanthropic support by appealing to donors who are increasingly sophisticated and expect philanthropic giving to have an impact not only on institutions, but on larger societal issues. The campaign will therefore be two-pronged: fundraising for well-defined priorities that can inspire as yet unaffiliated philanthropists in consideration of transformational gifts, as well as expanding the hospital’s base of grateful patient/family donors and foundation and corporation supporters
Ø Oversee the formulation and implementation of personnel policies and practices, in coordination with Human Resources colleagues. This will include monitoring and refining of recruitment activities, retention strategies and performance incentives; implementing performance metrics; reviewing compensation levels; and applying corrective or performance improving actions.
Ø Determine staff and material resources to grow fundraising, ensuring their optimum alignment with annual and campaign revenue goals
Ø Lead strategic and operational planning, policy development, problem solving, conflict resolution and crisis management (as needed)
Ø Guide the process of annual goal-setting, evaluating and optimizing current fundraising programs and adding innovative enhancements to achieve annual goals
Ø Oversee principal gift and major gift programs, including determining the optimum participation of the Senior Vice President
Ø Build a small portfolio of high capacity/VIP donors and prospects
Ø Catalyze, with relevant hospital senior vice presidents, chiefs, faculty leaders and major gift officers, the development of multi-disciplinary program concepts that position the hospital for transformational gifts
Ø Ensure the seamless integration and compliance of development activities with other functional areas in the hospital (i.e., marketing and public affairs, research administration, legal counsel, finance, information systems, facilities, etc.)
Ø Provide strategic counsel and mentoring to gift officers across the office for high profile complex and principal gift situations
Ø Contribute to and enhance a culture of aspiration, innovation, collaboration, and transparency.


Qualifications

Ø Proven ability to create systems and practices in major and principal gift fundraising that recognize and reconcile competing interests and that avoid or diminish conflicts
