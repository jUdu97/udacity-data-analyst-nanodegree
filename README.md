# Project 1: Investigate a Dataset
The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. This analysis was done using the Python libraries NumPy and pandas.

# Project 2: Real World Data Wrangling with Python
This project was conducting using the following steps:
- Gather two datasets - successfully extract data using two different data gathering methods and combine the data.
- Assess the data according to quality and tidiness metrics, identifying missing data.
- Clean the data to solve the issues found in the assessing step.
- Update the data store with the cleaned data.
- Produce visualizations on the cleaned data, and answer a brief research question on the dataset.

# Project 3: Communicate Data Findings
This project had two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process:
- Part I: Exploratory data visualization, which used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
- Part II: Explanatory data visualization, which produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying the findings was through transforming the exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
